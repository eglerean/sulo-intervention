# Dependencies

The code in this repository uses various R packages that are listed within the code. The data was preprocessed with custom python scripts available at https://github.com/eglerean/sulo

# Raw data description

The data is not included in the repository as it contains personal data that can be linked to an individual. Participants were not asked about the permission to share or open these data. If you want to reuse this code, prepare the data in tidy format: each row is a subject and the columns can be seen in section 5 of the R code. Some columns are categorical and those are mapped in section 4.

# Description of the code
The code contains inline comments that explain what each step does.

## Improvements

The following improvements to the tool can be made

1. Add a synthetic data file for testing the script
2. Improving code readability
3. Removing hard-coded paths for reusability
